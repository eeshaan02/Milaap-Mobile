## Migration Notes

1. **High Priority Packages**:
   - Navigation-related packages (@react-navigation/*) have been updated to v6
   - Firebase packages updated to v21
   - Redux ecosystem packages have major version updates

2. **Breaking Changes to Watch For**:
   - React 18 migration might affect lifecycle methods
   - Navigation API changes from v5 to v6
   - Redux toolkit 2.x has significant changes
   - React Native 0.75.4 may require additional configuration changes
   - Masked View package has moved to new organization (@react-native-masked-view)

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Focus on migrating high-priority packages first (Sentry, AppCenter, Navigation gestures)
   - Test each major version upgrade thoroughly
   - Update Android and iOS native configurations as needed
   - Consider removing unused packages

4. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Test each package individually after migration
   - Focus on navigation flow after React Navigation updates
   - Verify firebase functionality
   - Check redux state management
   - Validate all UI components with react-native-elements
